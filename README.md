Check out [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/comments/tzw8e9/i_sorted_the_2022_historical_data/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for the sorted dataset I use.

* make sure the filepath is correct for the imports
* make sure you have a python venv going with everything in the `requirements.txt` installed
* go!

This might be a good cutoff for the whiteout:
